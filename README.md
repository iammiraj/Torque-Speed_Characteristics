<h1 align="center">Torque - Speed Characteristis of Three Phase Induction Motor. </h1>
<br>

<p align = "center">T = (K*s*Es^2*Rs)/(Rs^2+(s*Xs)^2)</p>
<br>
Where,
<br>
T = Torque
<br>
K = (3/2*pi*Ns)
<br>
Ns = Synchronus Speed
<br>
s = Slip
<br>
Es = Standstill rotor emf/phase
<br>
Rs = Standstill rotor resistance/phase
<br>
Xs = Standstill rotor reactance/phase
<br><br>
When, 
<br>
1. s = 0, T = 0. <br>
3. s is close to 0, (sXs) term is negligible. So, T ∝ s ; Considering other terms as constant.<br>
4. As s increases, (sXs) is not negligible. So, T ∝ 1/s ; Considering other terms as constant.
